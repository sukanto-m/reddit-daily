🚀 Reddit Daily – 2025-11-28

If you missed Reddit today, here’s what actually mattered 👇
💡 Theme
Solid mix of practical tips, charts, and mild hardware coping.

🔥 Signals from the trenches
• r/MachineLearning → [D] Got burned by an Apple ICLR paper — it was withdrawn after my Public Comment.
• r/LocalLLaMA → Yes it is possible to uncensor gpt-oss-20b - ArliAI/gpt-oss-20b-Derestricted

📊 Why this matters
Practitioners are quietly reshaping how AI gets built and deployed:
• More focus on efficiency and local tooling
• Visual storytelling through data (maps, charts, animations)
• Real-world constraints driving design decisions, not just benchmarks



🧭 My read
The interesting work is happening in the margins — small models, scrappy setups, careful visualisation.
That’s where the next wave of practical AI impact is coming from.
